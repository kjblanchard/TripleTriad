## Requirements

Requires Unity 2019.4 LTS or newer. Not supported on WebGL, due to unusable/faulty `PlayScheduled` and other scheduling methods. (Despite the documentation [says it is supported](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-audio.html), it is not.)

## Documentation 

Online documentation is available at : https://exceed7.com/introloop.

Without internet access, there are also **offline documentation and samples** included in this package.

1. Unzip **Documentation~.zip** and **Samples~.zip** to get **unimporting folders** named `Documentation~` and `Samples~`. These folders ending with `~` can be left inside the package without Unity Asset Database picking them up and import assets inside as a part of the game.
2. Inside `Documentation~`, you can read an entire documentation website completely offline with any Markdown reader by starting at `index.md`. All links and images works like on the website.
