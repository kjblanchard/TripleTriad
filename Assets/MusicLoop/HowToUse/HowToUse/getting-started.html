<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<section>

<p>Here's how to play your first audio with Introloop.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>First you should license this plugin <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/51095" target="_blank">from Unity's Asset Store</a>. After importing, a folder <code>Assets/Introloop</code> will appear in your project's <b>Root</b>, along with <code>Assets/Resources/Introloop/IntroloopPlayer.prefab</code> in your <b>Resources</b> folder.</p>
    
<p>Prefabs in <code>Assets/Resources/Introloop</code> are called <b>template prefab</b>. It is required to be in Resources folder with this exact name and location. Introloop can start in singleton mode or local mode, in singleton mode it will base its settings from this prefab. (More on this later)</p>

<p>If your game is using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html" target="_blank">Assembly Definition Files (asmdef)</a>, link your game's to Introloop's <code>E7.Introloop</code> assembly to gain access to <code>using E7.Introloop;</code> namespace in your code.</p>

<h2>Finding boundaries</h2>
<p>After you got an audio that you would like to play we will need 2 time points. The first point is called <b>"Intro Boundary"</b> which is the point that separates an intro from the rest of the song. The 2nd point is <b>"Looping Boundary"</b>. When the playhead arrives at this point it will go back to Intro Boundary. Ideally the audio bits after both boundary should sound exactly the same, so you have to be precise here. </p>
<p>If possible you should ask these point directly from your composer, since in the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) there is a beat grid to snap to and it is a sure fire way to get the exact time!</p>
    <img src="getting-daw-cfeb5.png" alt="Getting exact boundaries from DAW"/>

<h3>What if I already have the music but cannot contact my composer?</h3>

<p> In this situation you can use a free program like
    <a href="http://audacityteam.org" target="_blank">Audacity</a> to find the Intro and Looping Boundary by yourself. Timing might be difficult since there is no snap, but
    zooming closely to the waveform you should see a meaningful transient that you can match.
    <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/tutorial_looping.html"
        target="_blank">There is an article from the Audacity team of how to make a looping audio</a>. If you follow the guide and successfully
    cut a looping part, you have already got 2 time points required for Introloop which is the begining and end point that
    you cut.</p>
<img src="getting-audacity-48b57.png" alt="Using Audacity to get boundaries" />

<h3>So the music data after Looping Boundary is never heard?</h3>
<p>Correct, but you should leave some tail after that boundary anyway (like 1 second) just in case an unexpected lag happen
    and for small compression artifact. Tell your composer to render a bit more after the planned Looping Boundary.</p>

<h2>Making an <code>IntroloopAudio</code> asset file from an imported <code>AudioClip</code></h2>

<p>Next please <b>right click an audio file</b> in Unity then <b>Create &gt; IntroloopAudio</b>. A new asset file should appear alongside your original audio file.</p>

    <img src="index-introloop-de2d6.png" alt="Making IntroloopAudio file"/>

<p>This is called an <code>IntroloopAudio</code> file. You will use this file instead of original audio to issue <code>Play</code>. (But don't delete the original audio file from the project!) There is a custom inspector if you click it.</p>

<p>
    The <b>Audio Clip</b> field has already been connected for you to the file you right clicked. Next, you should enter the <b>Intro Boundary</b> and <b>Looping Boundary</b> time value you got earlier <b>in seconds</b>.
</p>
    
<p>
    You can also set a default volume here which is convenience for balancing music level, since normally Unity cannot store playback volume information in the <code>AudioClip</code> directly. Starting from v2.0 you can also set a constant pitch modification.
</p>

    <img class="img-responsive center-block article-image" src="getting-set-13817.png" alt="Setting IntroloopAudio's values"/>

<p>
    There are 3 playback modes to choose from which you can set <b>per audio</b>. The <b>Introloop</b> mode is the point of this plugin. <b>Loop</b> and <b>Non looping</b> is for playing like Unity normally did with Loop checked and unchecked in <code>AudioSource</code> respectively. For these 2 modes the boundaries is ignored, but you will still get Introloop's crossfade, auto audio unloading, etc. benefits. Also, Loop mode is not using a regular <code>AudioSource</code>'s <code>loop</code>, but using the same precise scheduling methods used to implement the Introloop mode. You could try this if regular looping wasn't accurate enough for you.
</p>

<h2>Playing an <code>IntroloopAudio</code> with the <code>IntroloopPlayer</code></h2>

<p>
    First of all include the namespace <code>using E7.Introloop;</code> to your file. Make sure you have already link up the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html" target="_blank">Assembly Definition Files (asmdef)</a>, to Introloop's <code>E7.Introloop</code>.
</p>

<p>In any of you component script, declare <code>public IntroloopAudio myIntroloopAudio;</code> in your script to expose the variable to your inspector. Then drag the <b>IntroloopAudio asset file</b> to the slot. Or you can place the file in <b>Resources</b> folder and dynamically load it via <code>Resources.Load(string)</code>. (not recommended) Either way you will get an instance of type <code>IntroloopAudio</code> in your script.</p>

<p>Next we need an <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> to play this <code>IntroloopAudio</code>. You have mainly 3 ways of obtaining the player.</p>

<h3>1. Singleton <code>IntroloopPlayer</code></h3>

<p>
    The easiest way which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_blank">singleton pattern</a>. By calling a static property <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance</code> for the first time, a set of game objects (ultimately consists of 4 <code>AudioSource</code>) will appear on the hierarchy under the scene <b>DontDestroyOnLoad</b>. It will persists indefinitely and does not stop playing a song even if you load a next scene with <code>LoadSceneMode.Single</code>.
</p>

    <img src="getting-scene-066a3.png" alt="Introloop in hierarchy"/>

<p>
    This is where a <b>template prefab</b> comes into play. If you don't have any it will create the player game objects just fine, but with template prefab you could set some properties beforehand, like mixer routing which you need to connect it to a mixer asset file of your game and is difficult to do via scripting. In the image above mixer is not connected, but if you had set one in the template prefab folder it will appears with that mixer.
</p>   

<p>
    In summary, with just <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance.Play(myIntroloopAudio);</code> you should already be able to hear seamlessly looping audio with intro! The image below demonstrate a simple class that can choose to play one of many <code>IntroloopAudio</code> that I have.
</p>

    <img src="getting-script-d3279.png" alt="Scripting Introloop example"/>

<h3>2. Subclassed singleton <code>IntroloopPlayer&lt;T&gt;</code> (Advanced)</h3>

<p>
    With <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance.Play</code>, it refers to the same "Instance" throughout your game. Meaning that you cannot have 2 concurrent Introloop player playing+looping at the same time.
</p>

<p>
    However from version 3.0 onwards you can create a subclass like this : <code>public class MySubclass : IntroloopPlayer&lt;MySubclass&gt; { ...</code> (Please put itself in the generic just like that) Then you will gain a new singleton static accessor : <code>.Get</code>
</p>
        
<p>
    With <code>MySubclass.Get</code>, it works like <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance</code> but will spawns a different set of player! This means you can now have many Introloop playing at the same time. It is useful for dividing the players into several parts. Like BGMPlayer, AmbientPlayer, etc. You could have a looping BGM with intro, playing along with seamlessly looping wind sound.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, you can then define your own methods on your subclass to be more suitable for your game. Like <code>FieldBGMPlayer.Get.PlayDesertTheme()</code> instead of <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance.Play(desertTheme);</code>. And the full potential lies in that the template prefab file is not the same as <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> ones. The name was hardcoded as the same as your class name. If your class name is <code>FieldBGMPlayer</code> then you must have <b>FieldBGMPlayer.prefab</b> in the same location as <b>IntroloopPlayer.prefab</b> in Resources folder. (Can be redefined in <b>IntroloopSettings.cs</b> constant fields.)
</p>

<p>
    For example, if your subclass name is <code>DemoSubclassPlayer</code> here is how you might set it up. Note the template prefab name which must be the same as your class's name. Look in the inspector, we can now even declare and connect all the <code>IntroloopAudio</code> we wish to play directly in the player! (Not as a reference on any scene.)
</p>

    <img src="getting-subclass-e3bdb.png" alt="Introloop subclass singleton"/>
<p>
    See the <b>IntroloopDemoSubclass</b> demo scene if you have any trouble setting this up.
</p>

    <img src="getting-subclassdemo-b413c.png" alt="Introloop subclass demo"/>

<h3>3. Local, positional <code>IntroloopPlayer</code>(Advanced)</h3>

<p>
    From version 3.0 you can now have non-static <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> anywhere in the scene as many instances as you like. If you do, you need to keep and access it with a normal <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> variable. (That is not a result of <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance</code> call, that is a global, singleton ones.)
</p>

<p>
    How to get one is easy, just attach <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> component to one of your game object <b>in the scene</b>. All of the required <code>AudioSource</code> will be spawned directly as a child of this game object after an <code>Awake</code> of the component. Or an another way, you could <code>gameObject.AddComponent&lt;IntroloopPlayer&gt;()</code> anytime. The next frame all of the required audio sources will be ready.
</p>

<p>
    The local Introloop <b>does not</b> automatically get <code>DontDestroyOnLoad</code> like <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance</code> or <code>Subclass.Get</code> ones, thus they will stop playing if you change scene with <code>LoadSceneMode.Single</code>, etc. Also, it will be <b>positional</b> by default. (Spatial blend is 1, or full 3D.)
</p>

<p>
    The point of having a local Introloop is that you would like it to be positional. Imagine you have bushes with an individual seamlessly looping leaf sound somehow with an intro. And you also want these to get louder as the player approaches it. You could make local Introloop on the bush. Note that each one will uses 4 <code>AudioSource</code>.
</p>

<p>
    This might be confusing, so see the <b>IntroloopDemoLocalPositional</b> demo scene if you have any trouble setting this up.
</p>

    <img src="getting-localdemo-8414f.png" alt="Introloop local positional demo"/>

<h2>How to route audio to your own <code>AudioMixerGroup</code></h2>

<p>It is difficult to get the audio mixer asset file at runtime to connect, so you should utilize the <b>template prefab</b> in <code>Assets/Resources/Introloop/IntroloopPlayer.prefab</code>. The <code>IntroloopSetting</code> class inside <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> component has a slot for <code>AudioMixerGroup</code>. The first time <code>IntroloopPlayer.Instance</code> was called, the settings will also be copied too.</p>

    <img src="getting-mixer-f7847.png" alt="Introloop mixer routing"/>

<p>On that template prefab you can find other settings such as default fade length, used when calling method with the word <code>Fade</code> without <code>fadeLengthSeconds</code> argument and even an option to turn on logging. When using a subclassing way, the name of prefab needs to match the class name.</p>

<p>
    You can also set a mixer routing at runtime with <code>myIntroloopPlayer.SetMixerGroup</code> which propagates the mixer group to all <code>AudioSource</code> it uses. If you have any needs to do other things to all 4 <code>AudioSource</code> of <code>IntroloopPlayer</code> at once, you can <code>foreach</code> on <code>myIntroloopPlayer.InternalAudioSources</code> property.
</p>

<h2>Pay attention to your <code>AudioClip</code>'s import settings</h2>

<p>
    Your <code>AudioClip</code> made up the <code>IntroloopAudio</code> asset, and the play is fully respecting every import settings you made there.
</p>

<h3>Preload Audio Data is not recommended!</h3>
<p>
    I recommend you to <b>uncheck Preload Audio Data</b> for all audio you planned to use with Introloop. Since if checked, merely having reference to <code>IntroloopAudio</code> in any <code>GameObject</code>'s inspector slot will cause the audio to be loaded into memory at scene start even if you are not going to play it yet. 
</p>
    
<p>
    This is Unity's default, Unity scans all references in the scene and load all of them at start. Be it texture, <code>ScriptableObject</code>, etc. But luckily only for audio we have this checkbox unchecking to prevent it. For other things, we need to deliberately place them in Resource folder or use the new <a href="https://forum.unity.com/forums/addressables.156/" target="_blank">Addressable Asset System</a>, don't have them attached to any inspector slot in the scene, and finally load them via string path of <code>Resources.Load</code> or <code>Addressables.Load</code>. All these inconveniences just to prevent the auto load. (You can also <a href="https://gametorrahod.com/unity-texture-memory-loading-unloading-7054819e4ae8" target="_blank">read my research</a> regarding texture memory loading.)
</p>

    <img src="getting-import-24432.png" alt="Recommended audio import settings"/>

<p>
    And also Introloop has some optimized loading logic. It loads only when you call <code>Play</code>. It unloads immediately on <code>Stop</code>, after a crossfade has ended if any. (Unity's default does not unload an audio on stopping.) So if you check Preload Audio Data this optimization loading logic will be useless. Even if you want an audio preloaded to have the fastest start on <code>Play</code>, I have also provided <code>.Prepare()</code> method that can force the load anytime without playing.
</p>

<h3>Load In Background</h3>
<p>
    You can use either. With Load In Background, a <code>Play</code> call will be non-blocking and Introloop will properly wait for an audio to fully load before playing at several frames later. (This wait is with a coroutine running on the <code>IntroloopPlayer</code>) Without Load In Background, a <code>Play</code> will be a blocking call. An audio will be surely played in the same frame but the game might lag a bit depending on your audio size and compression settings. An advanced method <code>.Prepare()</code> can force a load so that the next <code>Play</code> is instant.
</p>

<h3>Compression and Quality</h3>
<p>
     As advertised we don't need to physically cut an audio file with Introloop, we could use any compression format we want without fearing the dreaded compression artifacts/offset samples at the edge of waveform ruining the loop. Smash the quality down as much as you like to save space, it will still loop seamlessly. Also you could also resample it down to lower rate to save even more space.
</p>

<h3>Load Type</h3>

<p>
     Decompressed load and compressed in memory works flawlessly. But there is a slight problem with <b>Streaming</b>. In this mode, Unity's API does not allow a full load. A load command just load a very small chunk (the "buffer size" just enought to start streaming). The result is that <code>Play</code> starts eagerly while the rest is being loaded at the same time. This might cause <b>the first loop</b> to be mistimed and not so seamless if called when your game is busy. Unloading also does not work, but it is not required anyways since with Streaming you are already using a very small amount of memory throughout the play.
</p>

<p>
    If you really needs to use Streaming mode with Introloop, at least wait a frame or two after <code>Awake</code>, <code>Start</code> so that the game is less busy. The reason is that in other compression mode the loading code can wait properly and does not matter if the game is busy or not. When this problem happen you will hear that at the first loop it "skips" to the loop point just a bit too early before the song actually get there. This is because the schedule starts on-time but the song actually starts a bit later, the schedule is running ahead of the song.
</p>

<p>
    Update : From version 4.0.0 onwards, there is a slight delay offsetted <b>to the scheduling</b> on each play. This helps stabilize Streaming load type greatly. The mentioned problem could still occur if the game lags more than this added offset, which is just a bit more than 1 frame of 60 FPS. You can change this in the source <code>IntroloopTrack.cs &gt; float smallPrepareTime</code> if you wish.
