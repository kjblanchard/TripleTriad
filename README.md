# TripleTriad - Recreating Triple Triad In C# and Unity
![Picture didn't load idiot](https://github.com/kjblanchard/TripleTriad/blob/master/img/intro.png?raw=true)

- Recreated the FF8 minigame for a project I'm working on.

- Used Unity as the game engine.
- Used GIMP and asperite for creating the sprites and spritesheets.
- Used images and music that was either ripped from games, or publically available to download on the internet.  I don't claim any of the graphics or music is mine.

## If you just want to play the game, here is a link:
