# TripleTriad
Recreating Triple Triad In C# and Unity

Recreated the FF8 minigame for a project I'm working on.

Used Unity as the game engine.  Used GIMP and asperite for creating the sprites and spritesheets.  Used images and music that was either ripped from games, or publically available to download on the internet.  I don't claim any of the graphics or music is mine, but the code is 100% created by me.

If you just want to play the game, here is a link:
