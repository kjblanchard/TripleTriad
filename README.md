# TripleTriad
Recreating Triple Triad In C# and Unity


I made a pretty quick Triple triad recreation as my first c# project done completely on my own.  6 months later, I've recreated it into this to improve on my coding techniques and animations.

This is by no means perfect, and programmed by someone who didn't go to college for programming, and just started in August of 2019.  It probably took me about 2 months to get this working.

Used Unity as the game engine.  Used GIMP and asperite for creating the sprites and spritesheets.  Used images and music that was either ripped from games, or publically available to download on the internet.  I don't claim any of the graphics or music is mine, but the code is 100% created by me.

If you just want to play the game, here is a link:
