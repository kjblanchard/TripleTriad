![Picture didn't load idiot](https://github.com/kjblanchard/TripleTriad/blob/master/img/intro.png?raw=true)
- Build Status: <br>
[![Push files to S3](https://github.com/kjblanchard/TripleTriad/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kjblanchard/TripleTriad/actions/workflows/main.yml)
- Old project when I was learning programming, C# code doesn't follow standards I would use nowadays (Very bloated, too many functions, partial classes, etc)
- Recreated the FF8 minigame for a project I'm working on.
- Used images and music that was either ripped from games, or publicly available to download on the internet.  I don't claim any of the graphics or music is mine.

## 2023 Updates
- Build with github workflows
- Hosted on https://tripletriad.supergoon.com
- Updated Unity to 2022.3.10
- Bugfixes

## Rules
- Just like the ff8 minigame Triple Triad, you flip cards by having a higher card value on the side the opposing card is on.  Player who has most cards flipped to their color when the board is full wins.
